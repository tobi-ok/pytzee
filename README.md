# Pytzee

Python implementation of the classic Yahtzee with modified rules.

## Modifications:

- Skip option: Allows players to skip scoring a turn.
- Count scoring: Players can score based on specific dice values (e.g., "count 2").
- Scorecard display: Enhanced readability with a tabular format.
- Strict full house logic: Requires exact pair and three-of-a-kind pattern.
- No duplicate scoring: Prevents reusing categories with moves_used.
- Custom rounds: Players choose the number of rounds instead of fixed 13
